<h3>Size</h3>

<p>
        Tigers are the most variable in size of all big cats, much more so than lions.[63] The Bengal and Siberian subspecies are the tallest at 
        the shoulder and thus considered the largest living felids, ranking with the extinct Caspian tiger among the biggest that ever existed.[64] 
        An average adult male tiger from Northern India or Siberia outweighs an average adult male lion by around 45.5 kg (100 lb).[63] Males vary 
        in total length from 250 to 390 cm (98 to 154 in) and weigh between 90 to 306 kg (198 to 675 lb) with skull length ranging from 316 to 383 mm 
        (12.4 to 15.1 in). Females vary in total length from 200 to 275 cm (79 to 108 in), weigh 65 to 167 kg (143 to 368 lb) with skull length ranging 
        from 268 to 318 mm (10.6 to 12.5 in).[65] The largest wild tiger ever reported had a total body length of 3.38 m (11.1 ft) over curves and weighed 
        388.7 kg (857 lb).[citation needed] In either sex, the tail represents about 0.6 to 1.1 m (24 to 43 in) of total length.[22] Body size of different 
        populations seems to be correlated with climate—Bergmann's rule—and can be explained by thermoregulation.[22] Large male Siberian tigers can reach 
        a total length of more than 3.5 m (11.5 ft) over curves and 3.3 m (10.8 ft) between pegs, and can weigh up to 306 kg (675 lb). This is considerably 
        larger than the weight of 75 to 140 kg (165 to 309 lb) reached by the smallest living subspecies, the Sumatran tiger. At the shoulder, tigers may 
        variously stand 0.7 to 1.22 m (2.3 to 4.0 ft) tall.[44] The current record weight in the wild was 389 kg (858 lb) for a Bengal tiger shot in 1967.[64][66]
        They are a notably sexually dimorphic species, females being consistently smaller than males. The size difference between males and females is 
        proportionally greater in the larger tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females.[67] Males also have wider forepaw 
        pads than females, enabling gender to be told from tracks.[67]

<h3>Colouration</h3>
  
<p>
        A well-known allele found only in the Bengal subspecies produces the white tiger, a colour variant first recorded in the early 19th century and found in 
        an estimated one in 10,000 natural births. Genetically, whiteness is recessive: a cub is white only when both parents carry the allele for whiteness.[68] 
        It is not albinism, pigment being evident in the white tiger's stripes and in their blue eyes.[57] The causative mutation changes a single amino acid in 
        the transporter protein SLC45A2.[69] White tigers are more frequently bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool can lead to inbreeding. 
        This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and 
        strabismus (squint).[68] Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live as long as their orange counterparts. Attempts have been made to 
        cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.[70] Another recessive gene creates the "golden" or 
        "golden tabby" colour variation, sometimes known as "strawberry". Golden tigers have thicker than usual light-gold fur, pale legs, and faint orange stripes. 
        Few golden tigers are kept in captivity; they are invariably at least part Bengal. Some golden tigers carry the white tiger gene,[71] and when two such tigers 
        are mated, they can produce some stripeless white offspring. Although a "pseudo-melanistic" effect—wide stripes that partially obscure the orange 
        background—has been seen in some pelts, no true black tigers have been authenticated, with the possible exception of one dead specimen examined in 
        Chittagong in 1846. These wholly or partially melanistic tigers, if they exist, are assumed to be intermittent mutations rather than a distinct species.[72][73] 
        There are further unconfirmed reports of a "blue" or slate-coloured variant, the Maltese tiger. However, while some felids do exhibit this colouration as a solid 
        coat, there is no known genetic configuration that would result in black stripes on a blue-gray background.[72]

<h3>Habitat</h3>
  
<p>
        In the past, tigers were found throughout Asia, from the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea to Siberia and the Indonesian islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra. 
        Fossil remains indicate tigers were also present in Borneo and Palawan in the Philippines during the late Pleistocene and Holocene.[74][75]
        During the 20th century, tigers became extinct in western Asia and were restricted to isolated pockets in the remaining parts of their range. 
        They were extirpated on the island of Bali in the 1940s, around the Caspian Sea in the 1970s, and on Java in the 1980s. This was the result of 
        habitat loss and the ongoing killing of tigers and tiger prey. Today, their fragmented and partly degraded range extends from India in the west 
        to China and Southeast Asia. The northern limit of their range is close to the Amur River in southeastern Siberia. The only large island they 
        still inhabit is Sumatra.[1] Since the beginning of the 20th century, tigers' historical range has shrunk by 93%. In the decade from 1997 to 2007, 
        the estimated area known to be occupied by tigers has declined by 41%.[2][76]
        Tigers can occupy a wide range of habitat types, but will usually require sufficient cover, proximity to water, and an abundance of prey. Compared to the lion, 
        the tiger prefers denser vegetation, for which its camouflage colouring is ideally suited, and where a single predator is not at a disadvantage compared with 
        the multiple felines in a pride.[57] A further habitat requirement is the placement of suitably secluded den locations, which may consist of caves, large hollow trees, 
        or dense vegetation.[62] Bengal tigers in particular live in many types of forests, including wet, evergreen, and the semievergreen of Assam and eastern Bengal; 
        the swampy mangrove forest of the Ganges Delta; the deciduous forest of Nepal, and the thorn forests of the Western Ghats. In various parts of their range they 
        inhabit or have inhabited additionally partially open grassland and savanna as well as taiga forests and rocky habitats.
