            <h3>My Hobbies:
            </h3>
            <p>I have a few hobbies that I enjoy doing in my free time. I enjoy playing sports such as Football,Basketball, and Soccer and also follow the professional leagues for each of these sports. I also enjoy music quite a bit and listen to all kinds of music (except for country music.) I also enjoywatching many types of films and shows on television during my free time. My favorite activity to do aside from these hobbies would be to have a night out with some friends where I could socialize and have fun with others, but this has proven to be more difficult during these pandemic times.

            </p>
