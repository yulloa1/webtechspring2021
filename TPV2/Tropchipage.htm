              <h2>About Tropical Chinese</h2>
        <h3>
        <p>
            Tropical Chinese is a Dim Sum restaurant located right off of Bird Road next to Tropical Park 
            in South Miami. This restaurant is great to go to with big groups to share all the food served.
            Tropical Chinese serves Hong Kong Style push cart Dim Sum that is all handcrafted in their kitchen.
            This is probably the restaurant with the best reputation as it serves high quality authentic Dim Sum
            at a very reasonable price.
