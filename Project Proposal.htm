	<h1>Project Objective</h1>

	<p>The objective of this project is to demonstrate the design of a website that
		provides data regarding some of my favorite Asian Restaurants in South Miami
		and my personal reviews of them. This website will target lovers of Asian Food 
		in the South Miami area and inform them regarding some of the places that I 
		enjoy the most.
	<br> 
		Each page of this website will be specifically about one Restaurant. Each of these pages
		will provide the location, recommended dishes, and a short description/review of each 
		Restaurant.There will also be links to the available online resources these restaurants
		may have. Each page may also have images of food that each restaurant has or an online 
		menu for costumers to look at before going to or ordering from the restaurant.
	</p>
