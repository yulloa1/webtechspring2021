        <h1> Fall 2017 Midterm Question 2 - Q2.htm</h1>
        <p>
            (25 points) You are given 3 images-holders and three corresponding buttons. Create the functionality whereby: 1. When you click on the belt (or shoes), the belt (shoe) image is shown and the shoe (belt) image is set to a smiley face. <span>Please note that the "placeholder" image is just that - you don't have to do any thing with it.</span> 2. The button that was clicked, belt (shoes) must have a yellow background and the shoes (belt) button should have a white background. <span>The Reset button will always be lime in color - in other words, you don't have to worry about its color in your function.</span>  3. When the reset is clicked, all buttons should go back to having a lime background and none of the images should be shown.  
            Write it using a single function for full credit. For 20 points, write it using as many functions as you like.
